Universal University
Welcome to Universal University, a web-based education platform built using the Django web framework.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for educators to create and manage online courses, and for students to easily find and enroll in courses that interest them.

With Universal University, educators can create engaging and interactive online courses, complete with multimedia content, quizzes, and assignments. Students can enroll in multiple courses, track their progress, and communicate with their instructors and classmates.

To get started, simply sign up for an account and start exploring the available courses. Whether you're an educator looking to create and teach your own course, or a student looking to further your education, Universal University has something for you.

We hope you enjoy using our platform and we look forward to helping you achieve your educational goals.
